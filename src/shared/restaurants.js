        description: "This is my bf's mom's favorite Italian restaurant. She loves it so much that she randomly buys us takeout salad from there because apparently we don't eat enough vegetables. This review is solely based on the to go Italian Salad! And it was delicious. First, it is a good size. For only $6 you get a bunch of Romaine Lettuce, Peppers, Salami, Prosciutto, Olives, Cheese, Tomatoes and a good portion of dressing. Tbh, that gets them the 5th star because they aren't skimpy with dressing. I like my salad to not taste like salad.",

        description: "At this no-frills, fluorescent-lit restaurant, you’ll find Hawaii’s classic soul food, which Helena’s has been serving since 1946. It’s based off native Hawaiian staple dishes and those influenced by the island’s waves of immigration up until the ‘50s; highlights at Helena's Hawaiian Food are kalua pig (smoky pulled pork, Hawaiian-style), poi (taro milled and thinned into a puddinglike consistency) and Helena’s legendary pipikaula—meaty short ribs dried and then pan-fried.",

        description: "Visiting celebrities, from President Obama to Ben Affleck, all stop by for at least one meal in the Pig and the Lady’s boisterous dining room, where the menu melds Vietnamese and Southeast Asian flavors with modern sensibilities. Come for lunch, and you must order the pho French dip—meltingly soft slices of brisket paired with a Thai basil chimichurri and bean sprouts, served with a side of pho broth for dipping. The dinner menu constantly changes, but make sure to finish off with a swirled soft serve, which often comes in funky flavors like black sesame custard and mango sorbet.",
