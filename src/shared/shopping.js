The array of shops offers great souvenir options and all sorts of gift ideas. Representative items include candles, jewelry, clothing, Pacific crafts, fragrances, sunglasses, cigars, and island art. Onsite restaurants include Chai's Island Bistro, Gordon Biersch Brewery, and Don Ho's Island Grill. Make sure to visit the tower's observation deck while you're there.
